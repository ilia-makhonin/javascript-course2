        Just at this time there came to the Cowperwoods an uncle, Seneca Davis, who had not appeared in the
        life of the family before.
        Henry Cowperwood was pleased at the arrival of this rather rich relative, for before that Seneca Davis
        had not taken much notice of Henry Cowperwood and his family.
        This time, however, he showed much more interest in the Cowperwoods, particularly in Frank.
        <br>
        'How would you like to come down to Cuba and be a planter, my boy?' he asked him once.
        <br>
        'I am not so sure that I'd like to,' replied the boy.
        <br>
        'Well, that's frank enough. What have you against it?'
        <br>
        'Nothing, except that I don't know anything about it.'
        <br>
        'What do you know?" The boy smiled, "Not very much, I guess.'
        <br>
        'Well, what are you interested in?'
        <br>
        'Money.'
        <br>
        He looked at Frank carefully now. There was something in the boy ... no doubt of it.
        'A smart boy!' he said to Henry, his brother-in-law. 'You have a good family.'
        Uncle Seneca became a frequent visitor to the house and took an increasing interest in Frank.
        'Keep in touch with me,' he said to his sister one day. 'When that boy gets old enough to find
        out what he wants to do, I think I'll help him to do it.' She told him she was very grateful. He talked
        to Frank about his studies, and found that the boy took little interest in books or most of the subjects
        he had to take at school.
